# Full Stack Challenge: Microservice Starter

## Goal
To test your ability to be self sufficient, work with 3rd party data, and write code. You have about 4 hours to complete the challenge and at the end youâ€™ll present your work.

## Challenge
Write a Node.js server that pulls data from an external data source and returns it in the [Common Microservice API](CommonServiceAPI.md) format. This is a trivialized version of an API that is used on a Collinear Group project. The goal of the API is give a common API when working with many disparate time series data sources.

The external data source that you will use can be any kind of time series public data: a downloaded CSV, data you manually scrapped from a website, or a public API. It is up to you to choose the source.

## Evaluation
At the end of the alotted time you will join up with the Collinear Team and walk us through your approach. Be prepared for questions.

## Getting Started

You can refer to the existing `nodejs-example` as an example of a microservice that implements the [Common Microservice API](CommonServiceAPI.md).

Put all your code in a sub directory and include instructions on how to get started with your service.

Ready? Go!
